     <h2>Understanding JavaScript</h2>

      <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>


      <p>

      
       <strong>JavaScript</strong>often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong> is a <em>programming language</em>

       and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of the websites use JavaScript on 

       the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers

       have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's devices.


      </p>


      <p>


       <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the 

       ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

       It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has 

       application programming interfaces, (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard 

       data structure, and the Document Object Model (DOM).


      </p>


      
      <p>


       The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any input/output (l/0), such as networking, 

       storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript

       APIs for l/0).


       JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers

       and a variety of the applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.


       Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two 

       language are distinct and differ greatly in design.


      </p>


      <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>


      <p>


        JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it

        for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded on or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.


        All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.  


     </p> 


     <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior</p>


     <ul>


        <li> Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users


        of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.</li>


        <li> Web page animation, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>


        <li> Playing browser games.</li>


        <li> Controlling  the playback of streaming media</li>

         
        <li> Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>

      
        <li> Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li>


        <li> Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this


         data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>


        <li> Redirecting a user to another page.</li>


        <li> Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.</li> 



     </ul>


       <h3>Web Libraries and Framework</h3>

       
      <p>
       
        <strong>React</strong> (also known as ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for 

         building user interfaces based on components,. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a 

         community of individual developers and companies.


        <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered application with

        framework like <strong>Next.js</strong>. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and

        rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for the routing and other

        client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page

        that have change, avoiding unnecessary rerendering  of unchanged DOM elements.

      </p>


      <h3>Angular</h3>

       
     <p>


      <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>Typescript-based</strong>, free

       and open-source single-page web application framework led by  the Angular Team at Goggle and by a 

       community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from same team that built 

       Angular JS.


     </p>


      <h3>jQuery</h3>


     <p>


       In 2021, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of the

       websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and 

       frameworks.


     </p>


      <h3>Vanilla</h3>


     <p>


       The framework like monicker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is a term that has been coined for websites not 

       using any libraries or framework at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
