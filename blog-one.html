      <h2>What is Cascading Style Sheet or CSS?</h2>


      <p>Posted by <strong>EM Bandin</strong></p>


      <p>

        <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the

        presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML

        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of

        the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of the content and presentation, including layout,

        colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility;

        [further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of

        presentation characteristic; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the

        relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the

        structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improved the page load speed

        between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media

        type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C

        operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

      </p>

      <h2>Style Sheet</h2>

      <p>

        A style sheet consist of a list of its rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and

        a declaration block.

        Selector

        In CSS, selector declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in

        the markup itself.

      </p>

      <h2>Selector Types</h2>

      <p>

        Selectors may apply to the following:

      <ul>

        <li>all elements of a specific, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>

        <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>

        <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by hash prefix e.g.
          #id</li>

        <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix

          e.g. classmate (the phrase "CSS", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes-

          specified with the HTML class attribute-is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS

          subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats

          for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li>

        <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>

        <li>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,

          hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only

          be applied to a single element.</li>

      </ul>

      </p>

      <h2>Pseudo-classes</h2>

      <p>

        Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is contained in

        the document tree.

        One example of a widely used pseudo-class is: hover, which identifies content only when the user

        "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a

        selector as in a: hover or #elemented:hover.

        A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as:link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a

        selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the

        distinction between the double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation

        used for pseudo-classes.

      </p>

      <h2>Combinators</h2>

      <p>

        Multiple simple selectors may be joined using combination to specify elements by location, element

        type, id , class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example,

        div.myClass div{color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements,

        whereas.myClass div{color: red;}applies to all div elements that are inside elements of the class. This

        if not to be confused with concatenated identifies such as div.myClass {color: red}which applies to div

        elements of the class myClass.

      </p>

      <h2>Declaration Block</h2>

      <p>

        A declaration block consists of a pair of braces({}) enclosing a semicolon-separated list of

        declarations.

      </p>

      <h2>Declaration</h2>

      <p>

        Each declaration itself consist of a property, a colon (:) and a value. Optional white-space may be

        around the declaration block, declarations, colons, and semi-colons for readability.

      </p>

      <h2>Properties</h2>

      <p>

        Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some

        properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of element.

      </p>

      <h2> Values</h2>

      <p>

        Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels),

        50vw (50 percent of the viewpoint width) pr 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width).

        Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g.#FF0000, also

        abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255,0), RGBA values that specify both

        color and alpha transparency(e.g.rgba (255,0,0,0.8), or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%)

        hsla(000,100%, 50%) hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%

        Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length measures must include a

        length unit, which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage

        sign, as in 80%. Some units-cm (centimeter): in (inch): mm (millimeter); pc (pica); and pt (point)-are

        absolute, which means that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page;

        others-em (em); ex(ex) and px (pixel)[clarification needed)-are relative, which means that factors such

        as the font size of the parent element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a

        feature of CSS 1[14] and retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units

        Module Level # will, if adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units: ch; Q;

        rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.
      </p>

      <p>

        By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience errors and bugs in your code, but don't

        worry, you will overcome them all!
